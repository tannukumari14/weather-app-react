## Project Title and Description:
Title: Weather App
Description:
A weather forecasting app that fetches data from a weather API and displays current weather conditions, forecasts, and weather alerts.

## Installation and Setup Instructions:
This app requires a Next.js project. I have created a project named "Weather App" in Next.js with the command:
command:
npx create-next-app Weather App



## Technologies used.
1. Next.js: A React framework for server-side rendering, static site generation, and building optimized web applications.
2. Bootstrap: Used for responsive design and media queries.
3. OpenWeatherMap API: An API to fetch weather data including current weather, forecasts, and other related information.
4. React Hooks: For managing state and lifecycle in functional components.
5. Vercel: A platform for deploying Next.js applications, known for its seamless integration with Next.js.


## Features and functionalities.
1. Current Weather and Forecasts: The Weather App shows current weather conditions, forecasts, and weather alerts when the search button is clicked.
2. Flags: Displays the current temperature, description, sunset, and sunrise times using flag icons.
3. Responsive Design: Media queries are used to ensure the app is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile views.



This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
